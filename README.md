# Nika Sommer

Heyy ✌️,

```rust
// Currently in a pretty good state :]
// todo!("Finish profile README.md");
```

**I want to build software the you can love because it –**

- is performant
- acknowledges that errors will happen
  - displays them nicely
  - helps users in understanding them
- has readable code
- is well documentated (really have to work on this...)
- ✨️ looks nice ✨️
